## Purpose of the application

The purpose of meep is to help students across the University of Aberdeen to make new friends based on interests. Moreover, the function nearby implemented by the team, allows a student to find fellows closeby. The main reason of the application came up when COVID-19 hit and people became more and more shy and less interactive with each other.


## What to install
* Make sure you have installed node.js on your computer. 
  https://nodejs.org/en/

In case, you would like to run on your device, be sure to install Expo too. Expo can be found in the Play Store (Android) and/or in the App Store (IOS).
* Enter in folder of the project
* Open the Terminal
* run `npm install` in your Terminal. This command will install all the packages and dependecies used in the project.


## Run meep:
Meep can be executed only using Expo or via the deployed version reported above. 
The deployed version is hosted by responsinator, a service used by the developers to test and present their application but it does not represent the final version of the application because the service converts the mobile application into web and then re-converts back to the mobile version. Therefore, there might be some issues with UI and UX and this is because of React Native and Expo does not support the creation of executables for web but only for mobile. 

Consequently, our advice is to run meep locally by following the steps above. The full version can be provided only for Android or IOS.

Instructions for running the application:
* From the directory of the project, run `npm start`. This command will start the Expo server.
* open http://localhost:19006 in your browser
* you can choose to run the application on your device by choosing Android or IOS.
* scan the QR code with your device
